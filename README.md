# CS301
Assembly Language Programming

This is the final project for CS301 Fall 2020 @ UAF. It is a binary to hexadecimal quizer (flashcard type). It will generate a random binary number based on the
difficulty entered and you must type in the correct hexadecimal translation. 

Please note that this code is not the cleanest nor the simplist way to write this program -- and it is not meant to be. This project was written for an assembly language programming class and implements assembly language in a few ways.

This program was written on 64bit Linux and compilled with NASM and G++.
